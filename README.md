### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm [Moncef Belyamani](https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/), a Ruby, Rails, and automation consultant with 24 years of web development experience. Iâ€™ve helped teams and companies save thousands of hours ($100K+) per year by automating manual tasks, speeding up daily workflows and test suites, and eliminating or shortening meetings. I spent the most recent 9 years in Civic Tech at [Code for America](https://github.com/codeforamerica), [18F](https://github.com/18F) and [Truss](https://github.com/TrussWorks), where I shaped Engineering best practices.

I'm also known as the Ruby on Mac guy. Having helped thousands of people set up Ruby on their Mac over the past 10 years, I know how painful and time-consuming it is. Every day, folks from all over the world get stuck trying to build their dream app, or start their new Jekyll site, or get a Rails app running for their day job. 

To help people get back on track, I built [Ruby on Mac](https://www.rubyonmac.dev/?utm_campaign=gh-readme). With a single command, it sets up a complete Ruby development environment for you in 15 minutes or less! It can also fix common issues people run into when setting up a Mac for development, especially on Apple Silicon Macs (M1/M2). If you're having trouble installing Rails, Jekyll, Cocoapods, sqlite, ffi, or some other gem, give Ruby on Mac a try. 

I'm building Ruby on Mac in public, and sharing my progress on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/monfresh) and on [my blog](https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/tags/business/), although I've been more focused on the product than blogging lately. As of mid December 2022, I've made close to $38k, crushing my goal of $24k in 2022. My next goal is to reach $50k.

I also started an [automation/productivity newsletter](https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/newsletter) to show you how to speed up your repetitive workflows.
