### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm [Moncef Belyamani](https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/about/). After 9 years in Civic Tech at [Code for America](https://github.com/codeforamerica), [18F](https://github.com/18F) and [Truss](https://github.com/TrussWorks), I quit my job to try to make a living as a full-time creator. Having helped thousands of people set up Ruby on their Mac over the past 10 years, I know how painful and time-consuming it is. 

To help people save their precious time and avoid frustration, I built [Ruby on Mac](https://www.rubyonmac.dev/?utm_campaign=gh-readme). With a single command, it sets up a complete Ruby development environment for you in 15 minutes or less! It can also fix common issues people run into when setting up a Mac for development, especially on M1 Macs. If you're having trouble installing Rails, Jekyll, Cocoapods, sqlite, ffi, or some other gem, give Ruby on Mac a try. It's guaranteed to work, or your money back.

I'm building Ruby on Mac in public, and sharing my progress on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/monfresh) and on [my blog](https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/tags/business/) as I work towards my goal of $24k by the end of 2022. As of July 14, I'm at $17,764.

## I will save your company time and money through automation and speeding up test suites.

During my 9 years in Civic Tech, I saved over 1000 person-hours ($60k+/year) across various Rails projects and teams. Here are some examples of time savings I made:

- 10 weeks/year by eliminating and shortening meetings
- 7 weeks/year by speeding up a regularly-used Make command
- 4 weeks/year by automating recurring manual tasks 
- 8 weeks/year by speeding up test suites
- 1 week/year by automating the setup of a new Mac so that new Rails engineers could be up and running within minutes of opening their new laptop with a complete dev environment, all their Mac apps, and macOS preferences. (I've now turned this into a paid product at rubyonmac.dev/ultimate)

There are very likely similar time-saving opportunities at your company. I can identify them for you and create a detailed report with recommendations. If that sounds useful to you, I'd love to hear from you.

## Having trouble running legacy Rails or Jekyll projects on M1 Macs? I can help you!
From talking to Ruby on Mac customers and other Ruby developers, a common pain point is not being able to run legacy Rails and Jekyll projects on M1 Macs. This is due to the projects using old versions of Ruby, and old versions of gems that might not be maintained anymore and that aren't supported on the M1 chip. The gem most people complain about is `therubyracer`. They spend days trying to install it, and either end up giving up or using workarounds they're not happy with.

Instead of spending time getting the impossible to work, I recommend replacing `therubyracer` or eliminating it entirely. In many cases, one of these 3 solutions should work:

- Depending on what you're using `therubyracer` for, you might be able to just remove the gem and use Node instead.
- If the dependency on `therubyracer` comes from something related to `Less`, replace it with `Sass`.
- Try replacing `therubyracer` with `mini_racer`.

Another popular gem that gives people trouble on M1 macs is `ffi`, and the most common reason is using an older version of the gem. The general rule of thumb is to update any gem that is the source of the error in the stacktrace.

If you're still stuck getting your old Ruby projects to run, you can hire me and I'd be happy to help you. I'm taking on a limited number of clients at this time. Feel free to email me at my first name @ rubyonmac.dev and we'll go from there.
