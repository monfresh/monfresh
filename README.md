### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm [Moncef Belyamani](https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/), the creator of [Ruby on Mac](https://www.rubyonmac.dev/?utm_campaign=gh-readme), the fastest, easiest, and most reliable way to set up, restore, and maintain a proper Ruby development environment on a Mac. It's the result of helping hundreds of thousands of people over the past 12 years, and hundreds of hours of research and testing on 4 different Macs.

Every day, folks from all over the world get stuck trying to build their dream app, or start their new Jekyll site, or get a Rails app running for their day job. Ruby on Mac is guaranteed to get you unstuck right away, whether you're having issues with your existing dev setup, or setting up a new Mac. I have over 2000 happy customers since I launched it in February 2022. Read how much [people love Ruby on Mac](https://www.rubyonmac.dev/testimonials) and how much time it has saved them.

With a single command, Ruby on Mac sets up a complete Ruby development environment for you in 15 minutes or less! It automatically fixes common problems with existing dev setups, especially on Apple Silicon Macs (M1/M2). Sometimes that's not enough though, which is why it comes with a "reset" mode that can safely back up and clean up your dev setup in 1 minute, so you can reinstall everything in "normal" mode with a clean slate. This will save you hours that you would have spent backing up and reformatting your hard drive, and reinstalling macOS.

If you're having trouble installing gems or setting up a Rails, Jekyll, Flutter, React Native, or other Ruby project, give Ruby on Mac a try.

I'm also a Ruby, Rails, and automation consultant with 24 years of web development experience. Iâ€™ve helped teams and companies save thousands of hours ($100K+) per year by automating manual tasks, speeding up daily workflows and test suites, improving developer happiness, code quality and maintainability, and eliminating or shortening meetings. I spent the most recent 9 years in Civic Tech at [Code for America](https://github.com/codeforamerica), [18F](https://github.com/18F) and [Truss](https://github.com/TrussWorks), where I worked on open source Rails projects that serve millions of people, such as login.gov.
